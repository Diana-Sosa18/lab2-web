# Haunted Mansion 

## About this Project

This project is an interactive horror story developed as part of a web design laboratory.

The story places the player inside a mysterious haunted mansion where they must make decisions that affect the outcome of the game. Each choice leads to a different path, allowing multiple possible story developments.

## How It Works

The game is built using multiple HTML pages connected through links.

Each page represents a scene in the story, and the player progresses by selecting actions such as:

- Opening an object
- Picking up an item
- Exploring different options

These decisions lead the player to different pages, creating an interactive narrative experience.
The visual design is based on a horror theme, using dark colors and atmospheric elements to enhance immersion.
